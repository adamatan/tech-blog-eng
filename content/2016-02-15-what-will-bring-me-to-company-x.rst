I have been recently Linkedin-contacted by `Einat Frish <https://il.linkedin.com/in/einatfrish>`_, a recruiter from Cisco:

    I hope you are doing well, I am contacting you today since your LinkedIn profile caught my attention while searching for Sr. SW Cloud Architect for Innovation team at Cisco. ...

I am perfectly happy with `my curent job <https://il.linkedin.com/in/adamatan/>`_, so I shortly and politely declined the offer:

    Thanks for reaching out. This isn't a good fit for me now, but let's keep in touch.

Most recruiters would say their goodbyes now; instead -

    got it!

    by the way, what will bring you to Cisco? what will you find tempting and attractive?

That is a truly professional answer in my opinion, and a fairly rare one.

On the personal level, this conversation may lead to a conversion from a "No" to a "Maybe". For example,
if I think that company X is dealing with dead-old technology, she can refer me to some bleeding-edge technology
used in their latest project (or let another HR person, from a more attractive team, handle my case).

On the company level, a few "No"s from seemingly good candidates might lead the organization to some data-driven
strategic decisions. For instance, if too many candidates think that employees on the company are overworked,
they leadership team can set new WLB guidelines, increase the paid leave quota
or start a crazy parental leave policy and enjoy the free PR bonanza
(a `well-known industry trick <http://www.wsj.com/articles/netflixs-surprising-gift-for-new-parents-1438792809>`_; very few actually take them).

Last, but not least - such an answer gives me the impression that I'm not dealing with the usual fire-and-forget HR person,
which spams hundreds of candidates with the same position; With such answer, I'm far more likely to be in touch in the future,
when I'll be looking.

So, What attracts me in a tech workplace
----------------------------------------

The essence is **People** (With whom?), **Tech** (How?) and **Cause** (For what?).

**People**:

I would like to work with the nicest, and most brilliant, people I can find.

* Are they nice? Will I enjoy spending 9 hours a day with them?
* Does personal ego play a big role in the team?
* Is there a healthy engineering culture in the office?
* Are they top-notch developers? Some good signs might be-

  * Do they have ridiculously high Stackoverflow.com score?
  * Do they contribute a lot to open source on github?
  * Do they give talks in conferences and meetups?

**Tech**:

I fancy working on cutting-edge technology using the best tools and platforms possible.

* Is the team working on the latest technology, or fixing bugs on legacy systems?
* Will I get to work with the latest and tools possible? Am I confined to a specific toolset due to company-wide decision?
* Can I use open source in my projects? Is contributing back to open source encouraged?
* Will I get to learn new technologies and languages?

**Cause**

* Is the team creating a good and useful product I believe in?
* Will the product help users? Will users love it?
* Are the company and its products ethical?
* Will I be ashamed or embarrassed by the product (for example: is it helping dictators? Does it promote gambling or porn)?
